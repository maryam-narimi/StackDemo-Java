# Stack Implementation (Push & Pop) – Data Structures & Algorithms

This Java program demonstrates the implementation of a **Stack** data structure with basic operations: **Push** (add an element) and **Pop** (remove the top element). 
The program allows user interaction via a simple menu to perform stack operations and display the current stack contents.

## Features
- Add elements to the stack (Push)
- Remove the top element from the stack (Pop)
- Display all elements in the stack
- Handles stack overflow and underflow situations

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **NetBeans** or any Java IDE.
2. Make sure both `StackDemo.java` and `Main.java` are in the same package.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the `Main` class.
5. Follow the menu prompts in the console to perform stack operations.
